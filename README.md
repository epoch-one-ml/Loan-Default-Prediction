# Loan-Default-Prediction
Banks, microfinance institutions, and MFS/BNPL companies in Bangladesh face significant financial risks due to loan defaults. Traditional manual assessment methods often fail to capture subtle risk patterns hidden in customer income, spending behavior, past transactions, and demographic factors. As a result, institutions suffer high Non-Performing Loans (NPL), reduced profitability, and operational inefficiency. This project introduces a machine-learning–based loan default prediction system that analyzes customer data before loan approval and assigns a real-time risk score.
